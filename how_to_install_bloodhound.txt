		Run apt-get update:
		
		sudo apt-get update

neo4j will now automatically pull from that repo when it needs to install Java as part of its install processs

2.  Install neo4j

			wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
			echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable 4.0' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list

			sudo apt-get update

			sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

		Install neo4j community edition using apt:

			sudo apt-get install neo4j

		Start neo4j to be used to in the foreground:

			sudo neo4j console

3.  Split the console.

4.  Download the BloodHound GUI

		Download the latest version of the BloodHound GUI from https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases

5.  Place into to 'opt' directory in file system.  Change 'opt' ownership from root to kali.
		
		ls -la /opt
		sudo chown kali:kali /opt

6.  Now move into 'opt' directory.
		
		cd /opt

7.  Move download Bloodhound file into 'opt' directory.

		mv ~/Downloads/BloodHound-linux-x64.zip .

8.  Unzip Bloodhound file with:
		
		unzip BloodHound-linux-x64.zip

9.	Move Bloodhound into it's own directory.
	
		mv Bloodhound-linux-x65 bloodhound

10. Move into the bloodhound directory and make the Bloodhound binary an executable.
	
		chmod +x ./BloodHound

11. Now you dot slash Bloodhound.

		./BloodHound

12. Bloodhound should be started.  However, you'll need to change Neo4j passwords. So in a browser, type 'localhost:xxxx' where x is the number after localhost.

13. Enter the username 'neo4j' and the password 'neo4j' to get to the change password screen.  Change the password.

14. Go back to the Bloodhound login screen and enter your new password.

15. The Bloodhound install assumes the the Bloodhound ingestor (collector) has been installed.  If the ingestor is not installed, you must install it using:

	pip install bloodhound

16. Bloodhound has been installed into '/home/kali/.local/bin' directory.  This must be added to $PATH by adding to your ~/.zshrc file:
	
	Add the following at the very end of the .zshrc file:

		export PATH="$PATH:/home/kali/.local/bin"

	Save and close. Open a new terminal OR use the same terminal by invoking 'source ~/.zshrc' command.

17. Open '/etc/hosts' file and add the domain controller to the file.
	
		192.168.0.155     dc-1.xyz.local

	and also add to '/etc/resolv.conf' the domain server:

		nameserver 192.168.0.155

18. Now you should be able to start Bloodhound

		bloodhound-python -u flee -p monkey -dc dc-1.xyz.local --disable-autogc -d xyz.local
